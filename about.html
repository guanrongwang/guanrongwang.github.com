			<p>Hi, I'm Guanrong!</p>

			<p>I'm studying Human Computer Interaction (UX Design and Research) at University of Michigan. Previously, I studied Economics (and took many French and Art history classes) for undergrad.</p>
			<p>With combined knowledge in business economics and user experience design, I aim to create not only good in-product experience, but also overall good experience that bridges business needs and users needs.</p>
			<p>My interests in designing for better experiences stemmed from my experience of designing social service program, during which I used human-centered approach to understand marginalized communities and design for their needs, at the same time getting a taste of endless sunburn and mosquito bites :)</p>
